## Threads and Synchronization

This lab illustrates the problem of synchronization when many threads are operating on a shared object.  The general issue is called "thread safety", and it is a major cause of errors in computer software.

## Assignment

To the problems on the lab sheet and record your answers here.

1. Record average run times.
2. Write your explanation of the results.  Use good English and proper grammar.  Also use good Markdown formatting.

## ThreadCount run times

These are the average runtime using 3 or more runs of the application.
The Counter class is the object being shared by the threads.
The threads use the counter to add and subtract values.

| Counter class           | Limit              | Runtime (sec)   |
|:------------------------|:-------------------|-----------------|
| Unsynchronized counter  |1,000,00,000        |0.0839856        |
| Using ReentrantLock     |                    |                 |
| Syncronized method      |                    |                 |
| AtomicLong for total    |                    |                 |

## 1. Using unsynchronized counter object


1.1 Ans: The total should be zero but after the several run the total is not zero and it never the same.

1.3 Ans: Becasue The 2 threads share the same counter and those 2 threads are running at the same time so if 1 of them finished it will return it's counter value. This is why the total is not zero and not the same at each time.

## 2. Implications for Multi-threaded Applications

How might this affect real applications?  

## 3. Counter with ReentrantLock

answer questions 3.1 - 3.4

## 4. Counter with synchronized method

## 5. Counter with AtomicLong

answer question 5

## 6. Analysis of Results

## 7. Using Many Threads (optional)
